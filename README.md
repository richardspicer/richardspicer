# Richard Spicer

Security Engineer • CISSP • GCIH • GSEC

## What I Do

I research AI/ML security vulnerabilities — discovering how AI agents can be manipulated, building detection for those attacks, and publishing what I find.

## Current Projects

**[IPI-Canary](https://github.com/richardspicer/IPI-Canary)** — A security testing tool for detecting Indirect Prompt Injection vulnerabilities in AI agents. Generates documents with hidden payloads across 7 formats using 34 techniques, and listens for out-of-band callbacks as proof-of-execution. Built with an AI-assisted workflow — [case study included](https://github.com/richardspicer/IPI-Canary/blob/main/docs/AI-Assisted-Development.md).
